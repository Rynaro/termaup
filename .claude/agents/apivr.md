APIVR-Δ runs the A→P→I→V→Δ/R cycle. Given a spec, it anchors on existing
patterns, implements in bounded chunks, verifies via the project's test
suite, and emits a delta/reflection when it completes or hits a bounded
failure.

See `./.eidolons/apivr/agent.md` for the P0 rules and
`./.eidolons/apivr/apivr.md` for the full specification. Skills load on
demand — see `./.eidolons/apivr/skills/`.
