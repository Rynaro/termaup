# SPECTRA: Strategic Specification through Deliberate Reasoning

A cognitive architecture for AI agents that plan. Transforms ambiguous intent into executable specifications through structured reasoning cycles.

SPECTRA produces plans — never code. Output is always dual-format: human-readable Markdown + agent-executable structured data (YAML/JSON).

```

**Each phase:** THINK → ACT → OBSERVE → REFLECT (iterate until confident)

**Hard constraint:** During all SPECTRA phases, operate in READ-ONLY mode. No code, no file edits, no mutations. Plans only.

**Complexity ≥7/12** → Extended thinking (2x token budget)

---

## CLARIFY

**Trigger:** Every new request.
**Purpose:** Eliminate ambiguity BEFORE planning. Prevents 40%+ wasted effort.

1. **Parse Intent** — Extract WHO, WHAT, WHY, CONSTRAINTS.
2. **Identify Gaps** — What's missing, ambiguous, or assumes unstated context?
3. **Ask ≤3 Questions** — Numbered, specific, <200 chars each. Focus on decisions that change the plan's shape.
4. **Gather Structural Context** — Query codebase for existing patterns, dependency structure (imports, call sites), prior specs from memory, and project conventions (`spectra-conventions.md`, if installed).
5. **Assess Cognitive Load** — Estimate total reasoning depth required; flag multi-session tasks early.
6. **Skip** when intent is unambiguous AND constraints explicit AND context sufficient.

---

## S — SCOPE

**Trigger:** After CLARIFY.

1. Classify intent:

| Type | Pattern | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| `IDEA` | Vague concept | Heavy clarification, extract intent |
| `REQUEST` | Clear goal, missing specs | Full spec generation |
| `CHANGE` | Modify existing | Delta analysis + impact assessment |
| `BUG_SPEC` | Issue needs fix spec | Root cause → fix spec |
| `STRATEGIC` | Multi-project / quarterly | Theme-level, multi-agent coordination |

2. Score complexity (4-dimension matrix, 4–12 — see `scoring.md`).
3. Define boundaries: In Scope / Out of Scope / Deferred.
4. Log assumptions with risk-if-wrong.
5. Route: 4–6 standard | 7–9 extended (2x depth) | 10–12 human-in-the-loop.
6. **Identify Stakeholders** — Who reviews? Who's affected? Map approval chain early.

---

## P — PATTERN

**Trigger:** After Scope.

1. Query memory: past specs, reflections, architectural patterns.
2. Query codebase: existing implementations matching intent. Include project conventions if available.
3. Rank by MMR: `similarity - 0.3 × redundancy` (retrieve 15 candidates, select top 5).
4. Select strategy:

| Match | Strategy |
|-------|----------|
| ≥85% | USE_TEMPLATE — apply directly |
| 60–84% | ADAPT — pattern as skeleton |
| <60% | GENERATE — new, patterns as reference |

5. **Catalog Failure Patterns** — If memory contains prior failures on similar tasks, surface them as anti-patterns before Explore.

---

## E — EXPLORE

**Trigger:** Before Construct. **Never skip.**

1. **Generate Observations** — 3–5 distinct angles (performance, simplicity, extensibility, risk, pattern-fit).
2. **Construct Hypotheses** — 3–5 genuinely distinct strategies. No strawmen. Mandatory:
   - At least one conservative (low-risk, proven)
   - At least one pattern-leveraging
   - At least one innovative
3. **Score Each** — 7-dimension weighted rubric (see `scoring.md`): Alignment 25% + Correctness 20% + Maintainability 15% + Performance 15% + Simplicity 10% + Risk 10% + Innovation 5%.
4. **Expand Top 2** — File impact, dependency chain, approach-specific edge cases.
5. **Select with Rationale** — What, why, what traded off.
6. **Document Rejected Alternatives** — Record why each was rejected; prevents re-exploration in replanning.

If all hypotheses score within 5% → insufficient differentiation. Re-observe from different angles.

**Cognitive load note:** 3–5 hypotheses × 7 scoring dimensions approaches working memory limits (Miller, 1956). Beyond 5 hypotheses, evaluation quality degrades. If you need more than 5, the problem likely requires decomposition at the Scope level, not more hypotheses. See [THEORY.md](../research/THEORY.md#2-plan-diversity-and-information-theory) for the information-theoretic justification.

---

## C — CONSTRUCT

**Trigger:** Hypothesis selected.

**Hierarchy (enforced):**
```
THEME (Strategic Goal / Quarterly Objective)
└── PROJECT (Major Capability) — never "Epic"
    └── FEATURE (User-Facing Capability)
        └── STORY (Atomic Value Unit) — must pass INVEST (see scoring.md)
            └── TASK (Implementation Step)
```

**Every story requires:**
- User story: "As a [ACTOR], I want [CAPABILITY] so that [VALUE]"
- Timebox: 1d / ≤2d / ≤3d / ≤5d / ≤8d (never story points; >8d must decompose)
- Action Plan: specific verbs — Create, Extend, Modify, Test, Configure, Migrate
- Acceptance Criteria: GIVEN/WHEN/THEN
- Technical Context: pattern, files, dependencies
- Agent Hints: recommended agent class (reasoning/speed/specialist) + context files + validation gates
- Dependency references (story IDs) where applicable
- **Risk Tags** — P0 (blocks release), P1 (degrades experience), P2 (cosmetic)

Output: plan artifact at `plans/{date}-{feature}.md`.

---

## T — TEST

**Trigger:** Spec drafted.

**6-layer verification:**

| Layer | Check |
|-------|-------|
| Structural | Hierarchy intact? Stories independent? No orphaned tasks? |
| Self-Consistency | 3 alternative decompositions converge? (≥70% overlap = stable) |
| Dependency | All affected files identified? Call sites covered? Migration paths defined? File paths validated against actual project structure? |
| Constraint | NFRs met? Timeboxes realistic? Security/compliance implications addressed? |
| Process Reward | Does each step reduce risk / increase clarity? Is ordering optimal? |
| Adversarial | What could go wrong? What did we miss? What would a skeptical reviewer challenge? |

**Adversarial layer checklist** — check against the [Failure Taxonomy](../research/THEORY.md#6-failure-taxonomy-for-plan-diagnostics): Under-specification? Over-specification? Dependency blindness? Assumption drift? Scope creep? Premature optimization? Stale context?

**Adaptive verification budget:** For simple plans (complexity 4–6), Structural + Constraint layers may suffice. For high-complexity (10–12), add adversarial red-team and human review beyond the standard 6 layers. See [Plan Entropy](../research/THEORY.md#4-plan-entropy-an-adaptive-verification-budget) for formal guidance.

**Gate:** All pass → Assemble | Minor gaps → Refine (1 cycle) | Major → Refine (up to 3) | Fundamental → back to Explore.

---

## R — REFINE

**Trigger:** Test reveals gaps.
**Protocol:** Reflexion-style — diagnose what failed, explain root cause, prescribe fix, apply, re-verify.

5-dimension critique (1–5, target all ≥4 — details in `scoring.md`): Clarity, Completeness, Actionability, Efficiency, Testability.

Cycle 1 → all ≥3 | Cycle 2 → all ≥4 | Cycle 3 → all ≥4 or diminishing returns. **Max 3.** If gate not met → escalate with gap report.

**Diminishing returns rule:** If a cycle improves the mean score by <0.3 points (on the 1–5 scale), stop — further cycles are unlikely to yield meaningful improvement.

**Oscillation detection:** If any dimension *decreases* between cycles (e.g., Clarity improves but Efficiency drops), halt immediately. This indicates conflicting optimizations. Escalate with the conflict identified.

**Track what changed per cycle** — refinement log prevents oscillation (changing A, then changing it back).

---

## A — ASSEMBLE

**Trigger:** Verification passes.

**Deliverables:**
1. **Plan Artifact (.md)** — Scope, approach + rationale, story hierarchy, confidence report, execution sequence.
2. **Agent Handoff (.yaml)** — Metadata, stories with timeboxes/criteria/agent hints, execution plan.
3. **State Machine (.state.json)** — Session ID, per-step status/dependencies/files/verification, replanning history.

**Confidence gating:**

| Confidence | Decision | Action |
|------------|----------|--------|
| ≥85% | AUTO_PROCEED | Deliver, agents execute |
| 70–84% | VALIDATE | Deliver with flags, human reviews |
| 50–69% | COLLABORATE | Halt, request clarifications |
| <50% | ESCALATE | Hand to human with gap analysis |

Factors (25% each): Pattern match, Requirement clarity, Decomposition stability (≥70% self-consistency), Constraint compliance.

---

## PERSIST & ADAPT

**Persistence** — Plans stored as files, survive context windows:
```
plans/
├── {date}-{feature}.md          # Human-readable
├── {date}-{feature}.yaml        # Agent handoff
└── {date}-{feature}.state.json  # Execution state
```

On re-entry, load state file first to resume exact position.

**Adaptive replanning:**

| Failure Scope | Strategy |
|---------------|----------|
| Single step fails | **Patch:** re-plan failed step + 2 downstream |
| Multiple steps fail | **Partial:** re-enter at Construct for affected branch |
| Assumption wrong | **Full:** re-enter at Scope with new constraints |
| Over-planned | **ADaPT:** collapse remaining steps if complexity ≤5/12 |

**Replanning triggers explicit re-scoring.** Don't just patch — verify the patch against the same 6-layer test.

---

## Context Management

| Mechanism | Trigger |
|-----------|---------|
| **Compaction** — Summarize into knowledge artifact (Goal + Findings + Decisions + Open Questions + Files) | Context >80% capacity |
| **Plan Re-injection** — Load plan artifact into new context | New session / context reset |
| **State Resumption** — Load JSON state for exact position | Interrupted execution |
| **Structural Summary** — AST-level codebase map (functions, classes, interfaces) | Before planning on existing code |
| **Dependency Snapshot** — Import graph + call sites for impacted area | Before Construct phase |

---

## Agent Routing

SPECTRA is agent-framework agnostic. Map these capability classes to your agent system:

| Need | Capability Class | Handoff |
|------|-----------------|---------|
| Implementation | **Builder** (speed-class) | YAML spec + context files + gates |
| Complex reasoning | **Reasoner** (reasoning-class) | Full spec + extended context |
| Bug investigation | **Debugger** (diagnostic-class) | Fix spec + root cause + regression scope |
| Spec review | **Reviewer** (quality-class) | Draft + critique dimensions |
| Multi-agent work | **Orchestrator** (coordination-class) | Orchestration plan + assignments |
| Architecture | **Architect** (design-class) | Design decisions + constraint matrix |
| Codebase analysis | **Explorer** (retrieval-class) | Query + scope + retrieval hints |

---

## Memory

| Type | Purpose | Query When |
|------|---------|------------|
| Episodic | Past specs + reflections + outcomes | Pattern phase |
| Semantic | Templates, architectural patterns, conventions | Pattern phase |
| Procedural | Learned strategies, domain-specific heuristics | Scope phase |
| Execution | Plans, state files, replanning history | Re-entry, replanning |

Query memory BEFORE generating. ≥85% match → use template directly.

---

## Theoretical Foundations

SPECTRA's design decisions are grounded in decision theory, information theory, and cognitive science. For the formal treatment — including Expected Value of Information analysis for confidence gating, Shannon entropy-based adaptive verification budgets, Miller's Law justification for the 3–5 hypothesis range, scoring calibration protocols, and a formal failure taxonomy — see [THEORY.md](../research/THEORY.md).

## Installing SPECTRA in Your Project

SPECTRA is stack-agnostic. The cognitive architecture doesn't change — only the domain vocabulary in your stories and action plans does. Installation produces a `spectra-conventions.md` that maps SPECTRA's generic concepts to your project's actual patterns.

**Install once, then plan with the core cycle above — no installation overhead per session.**

| Scenario | How to Install |
|----------|---------------|
| **Greenfield** (new project) | Run `spectra-init.sh` → paste the adaptation prompt into any LLM → save as `spectra-conventions.md` |
| **Brownfield** (existing codebase) | Run `spectra-init.sh` (detects existing conventions and structure) → paste the adaptation prompt into any LLM → save as `spectra-conventions.md`. See [RETROFIT.md](../research/RETROFIT.md) for the full brownfield protocol with progressive depth analysis |

See `tools/spectra-init.sh` for the installer, or `examples/` for worked examples across different stacks.

**What the installer produces:** `spectra-conventions.md` — convention mapping, action verb mapping, validation gates, architectural boundaries. Consumed by CLARIFY (step 4) and Pattern (step 2) as part of normal structural context.

**What changes per stack:** file paths, naming conventions (FlowObject → Service, Repository → DAO), test framework references, deployment patterns.

**What never changes:** the SPECTRA cycle, hypothesis diversity, verification layers, confidence gating, artifact persistence.
