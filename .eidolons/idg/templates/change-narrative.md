# Change Narrative Template

Use for release notes, changelogs, and PR summaries — narrating what changed and why.

## Document Skeleton

```markdown
# [Release/Change Title]

---

## Changes

- **[Feature/Component name]** — [what it does and why it was added]. ([source])

## Breaking Changes

[If any changes break backward compatibility, document them prominently here.]

|--------|--------|-----------|
| [what changed] | [what breaks] | [how to adapt] |

[If no breaking changes: "No breaking changes in this release."]

---

## Guidance

- **Audience awareness**: Release notes for end users should omit Technical Notes and use benefit-oriented language ("Faster page loads" not "Reduced p95 latency by 40ms"). Internal changelogs can include full technical detail.
- **Categorization**: Use the Keep a Changelog categories (Added, Changed, Fixed, Removed, Deprecated). If a change doesn't fit cleanly, prefer the category closest to the user impact.
- **Breaking changes**: Always call these out prominently, even if the list is empty. Readers scan for this section specifically.
- **Source citations**: Link each change to its source (commit, PR, ticket) so readers can drill down.
- **Ordering within categories**: Most impactful changes first within each category.
