## Steps

### Step 1: [Action Title]

**Command/Action**:
```bash
[exact command or UI action]

### Step 2: [Action Title]

[Same structure. Every step must have expected output and failure handling.]

---

## Verification

[How to confirm the procedure completed successfully.]

```bash
[verification command(s)]
```

**Expected result**: [what confirms success]

---

## Rollback

```

## Guidance

- **Exactness**: Commands must be copy-pasteable. No pseudo-code or "something like" instructions.
- **Failure handling**: Every step needs a "if this fails" clause. A runbook without failure handling is dangerous.
- **Rollback**: Mandatory for Medium+ risk. If rollback is not possible, document that explicitly with `[GAP] No rollback procedure available — this operation is irreversible`.
- **Verification**: Both post-procedure and post-rollback verification must be included.
- **Audience**: Assume the reader is a competent engineer who has never performed this specific procedure before. Include enough context to act independently at 3 AM during an incident.
