## Convention Map (Installation Output)

Generated once during SPECTRA installation (see [RETROFIT.md](../research/RETROFIT.md) for brownfield projects). Saved at `.spectra/setup/spectra-conventions.md` in the consumer project — never in the project root, never duplicated into vendor-specific folders. Consumed by CLARIFY (step 4) and Pattern (step 2) as structural context.

```markdown
## 🗺️ CONVENTION MAP

**Project:** [name]
**Generated:** [date]
**Sources:** [list of convention files found + inference method]

### Quick Reference (Top 5 Conventions)
1. [Most important convention]
2. [Second most important]
3. [Third]
4. [Fourth]
5. [Fifth]

### Convention Mapping (SPECTRA → Project)
| SPECTRA Concept | This Project | Path Pattern | Exemplar |
|----------------|-------------|--------------|----------|
| Service / Business Logic | [convention] | [path] | [file] |
| Data Access | [convention] | [path] | [file] |
| Validation | [convention] | [path] | [file] |
| API Endpoint | [convention] | [path] | [file] |
| Test File | [convention] | [path] | [file] |

### Action Verb Mapping
| SPECTRA Verb | In This Project | Example |
|-------------|----------------|---------|
| Create | [convention] | [example] |
| Extend | [convention] | [example] |
| Modify | [convention] | [example] |
| Test | [convention] | [example] |

### Validation Gates (Default)
- P0: [critical gate]
- P1: [test gate]
- P2: [lint gate]

### Architectural Boundaries
[project-specific constraints that every SPECTRA spec must respect]

### Sources
| Convention | Source | Confidence |
|-----------|--------|------------|
| [convention] | [file + line or inference method] | HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW |
