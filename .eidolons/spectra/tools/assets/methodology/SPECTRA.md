# SPECTRA: Strategic Specification through Deliberate Reasoning

A cognitive architecture for AI agents that plan. Transforms ambiguous intent into executable specifications through structured reasoning cycles.

SPECTRA produces plans — never code. Output is always dual-format: human-readable Markdown + agent-executable structured data (YAML/JSON).

```

**Each phase:** THINK → ACT → OBSERVE → REFLECT (iterate until confident)

**Hard constraint:** During all SPECTRA phases, operate in READ-ONLY mode. No code, no file edits, no mutations. Plans only.

**Complexity ≥7/12** → Extended thinking (2x token budget)

---

## CLARIFY

**Trigger:** Every new request.
**Purpose:** Eliminate ambiguity BEFORE planning. Prevents 40%+ wasted effort.

1. **Parse Intent** — Extract WHO, WHAT, WHY, CONSTRAINTS.
2. **Identify Gaps** — What's missing, ambiguous, or assumes unstated context?
3. **Ask ≤3 Questions** — Numbered, specific, <200 chars each. Focus on decisions that change the plan's shape.
4. **Gather Structural Context** — Query codebase for existing patterns, dependency structure (imports, call sites), prior specs from memory, and **project conventions**: load `.spectra/setup/spectra-conventions.md` if the file exists. When present, its vocabulary (real module names, test framework, deploy targets, naming patterns) supersedes SPECTRA's generic placeholders ("FlowObject", "Repository") in every downstream phase. When absent, continue with generic defaults — conventions are optional enrichment, not a prerequisite.
5. **Assess Cognitive Load** — Estimate total reasoning depth required; flag multi-session tasks early.
6. **Skip** when intent is unambiguous AND constraints explicit AND context sufficient.

---

## S — SCOPE

**Trigger:** After CLARIFY.

1. Classify intent:

| Type | Pattern | Action |
|------|---------|--------|
| `IDEA` | Vague concept | Heavy clarification, extract intent |
| `REQUEST` | Clear goal, missing specs | Full spec generation |
| `CHANGE` | Modify existing | Delta analysis + impact assessment |
| `BUG_SPEC` | Issue needs fix spec | Root cause → fix spec |
| `STRATEGIC` | Multi-project / quarterly | Theme-level, multi-agent coordination |

2. Score complexity (4-dimension matrix, 4–12 — see `scoring.md`).
3. Define boundaries: In Scope / Out of Scope / Deferred.
4. Log assumptions with risk-if-wrong.
5. Route: 4–6 standard | 7–9 extended (2x depth) | 10–12 human-in-the-loop.
6. **Identify Stakeholders** — Who reviews? Who's affected? Map approval chain early.

---

## P — PATTERN

**Trigger:** After Scope.

1. Query memory: past specs, reflections, architectural patterns.
2. Query codebase: existing implementations matching intent. If `.spectra/setup/spectra-conventions.md` is loaded, prefer its named patterns / modules / frameworks over generic equivalents when ranking matches.
3. Rank by MMR: `similarity - 0.3 × redundancy` (retrieve 15 candidates, select top 5).
4. Select strategy:

| Match | Strategy |
|-------|----------|
| ≥85% | USE_TEMPLATE — apply directly |
| 60–84% | ADAPT — pattern as skeleton |
| <60% | GENERATE — new, patterns as reference |

5. **Catalog Failure Patterns** — If memory contains prior failures on similar tasks, surface them as anti-patterns before Explore.

---

## E — EXPLORE

**Trigger:** Before Construct. **Never skip.**

1. **Generate Observations** — 3–5 distinct angles (performance, simplicity, extensibility, risk, pattern-fit).
2. **Construct Hypotheses** — 3–5 genuinely distinct strategies. No strawmen. Mandatory:
   - At least one conservative (low-risk, proven)
   - At least one pattern-leveraging
   - At least one innovative
3. **Score Each** — 7-dimension weighted rubric (see `scoring.md`): Alignment 25% + Correctness 20% + Maintainability 15% + Performance 15% + Simplicity 10% + Risk 10% + Innovation 5%.
4. **Expand Top 2** — File impact, dependency chain, approach-specific edge cases.
5. **Select with Rationale** — What, why, what traded off.
6. **Document Rejected Alternatives** — Record why each was rejected; prevents re-exploration in replanning.

If all hypotheses score within 5% → insufficient differentiation. Re-observe from different angles.

**Cognitive load note:** 3–5 hypotheses × 7 scoring dimensions approaches working memory limits (Miller, 1956). Beyond 5 hypotheses, evaluation quality degrades. If you need more than 5, the problem likely requires decomposition at the Scope level, not more hypotheses. See [THEORY.md](../research/THEORY.md#2-plan-diversity-and-information-theory) for the information-theoretic justification.

---

## C — CONSTRUCT

**Trigger:** Hypothesis selected.

**Hierarchy (enforced):**
```
THEME (Strategic Goal / Quarterly Objective)
└── PROJECT (Major Capability) — never "Epic"
    └── FEATURE (User-Facing Capability)
        └── STORY (Atomic Value Unit) — must pass INVEST (see scoring.md)
            └── TASK (Implementation Step)
```

**Every story requires:**
- User story: "As a [ACTOR], I want [CAPABILITY] so that [VALUE]"
- Timebox: 1d / ≤2d / ≤3d / ≤5d / ≤8d (never story points; >8d must decompose)
- Action Plan: specific verbs — Create, Extend, Modify, Test, Configure, Migrate
- Acceptance Criteria: GIVEN/WHEN/THEN
- Technical Context: pattern, files, dependencies
- Agent Hints: recommended agent class (reasoning/speed/specialist) + context files + validation gates
- Dependency references (story IDs) where applicable
- **Risk Tags** — P0 (blocks release), P1 (degrades experience), P2 (cosmetic)

Output: plan artifact at `.spectra/plans/{date}-{feature}.md` (see the **Output Discipline** section below — all artifacts live under `.spectra/`).

---

## T — TEST

**Trigger:** Spec drafted.

**6-layer verification:**

| Layer | Check |
|-------|-------|
| Structural | Hierarchy intact? Stories independent? No orphaned tasks? |
| Self-Consistency | 3 alternative decompositions converge? (≥70% overlap = stable) |
| Dependency | All affected files identified? Call sites covered? Migration paths defined? File paths validated against actual project structure? |
| Constraint | NFRs met? Timeboxes realistic? Security/compliance implications addressed? |
| Process Reward | Does each step reduce risk / increase clarity? Is ordering optimal? |
| Adversarial | What could go wrong? What did we miss? What would a skeptical reviewer challenge? |

**Adversarial layer checklist** — check against the [Failure Taxonomy](../research/THEORY.md#6-failure-taxonomy-for-plan-diagnostics): Under-specification? Over-specification? Dependency blindness? Assumption drift? Scope creep? Premature optimization? Stale context?

**Adaptive verification budget:** For simple plans (complexity 4–6), Structural + Constraint layers may suffice. For high-complexity (10–12), add adversarial red-team and human review beyond the standard 6 layers. See [Plan Entropy](../research/THEORY.md#4-plan-entropy-an-adaptive-verification-budget) for formal guidance.

**Gate:** All pass → Assemble | Minor gaps → Refine (1 cycle) | Major → Refine (up to 3) | Fundamental → back to Explore.

---

## R — REFINE

**Trigger:** Test reveals gaps.
**Protocol:** Reflexion-style — diagnose what failed, explain root cause, prescribe fix, apply, re-verify.

5-dimension critique (1–5, target all ≥4 — details in `scoring.md`): Clarity, Completeness, Actionability, Efficiency, Testability.

Cycle 1 → all ≥3 | Cycle 2 → all ≥4 | Cycle 3 → all ≥4 or diminishing returns. **Max 3.** If gate not met → escalate with gap report.

**Diminishing returns rule:** If a cycle improves the mean score by <0.3 points (on the 1–5 scale), stop — further cycles are unlikely to yield meaningful improvement.

**Oscillation detection:** If any dimension *decreases* between cycles (e.g., Clarity improves but Efficiency drops), halt immediately. This indicates conflicting optimizations. Escalate with the conflict identified.

**Track what changed per cycle** — refinement log prevents oscillation (changing A, then changing it back).

---

## A — ASSEMBLE

**Trigger:** Verification passes.

**Deliverables:**
1. **Plan Artifact (.md)** — Scope, approach + rationale, story hierarchy, confidence report, execution sequence.
2. **Agent Handoff (.yaml)** — Metadata, stories with timeboxes/criteria/agent hints, execution plan.
3. **State Machine (.state.json)** — Session ID, per-step status/dependencies/files/verification, replanning history.

**Confidence gating:**

| Confidence | Decision | Action |
|------------|----------|--------|
| ≥85% | AUTO_PROCEED | Deliver, agents execute |
| 70–84% | VALIDATE | Deliver with flags, human reviews |
| 50–69% | COLLABORATE | Halt, request clarifications |
| <50% | ESCALATE | Hand to human with gap analysis |

Factors (25% each): Pattern match, Requirement clarity, Decomposition stability (≥70% self-consistency), Constraint compliance.

---

## PERSIST & ADAPT

**Persistence** — Plans stored as files, survive context windows:
```
.spectra/
├── setup/
│   ├── project-profile.md            # Stack/convention detection (generated by retrofit)
│   ├── adaptation-prompt.md          # LLM-adaptation prompt (generated by retrofit)
│   └── spectra-conventions.md        # Project vocabulary mapping (human-curated)
├── plans/
│   ├── {date}-{feature}.md           # Human-readable plan artifact
│   ├── {date}-{feature}.yaml         # Agent handoff (structured)
│   └── {date}-{feature}.state.json   # Execution state
├── state/
│   └── {date}-{feature}.session.md   # Session resumption notes (optional)
└── logs/
    └── {date}-{session-id}.log       # Replanning history (optional)
```

On re-entry, load state file first to resume exact position.

**Adaptive replanning:**

| Failure Scope | Strategy |
|---------------|----------|
| Single step fails | **Patch:** re-plan failed step + 2 downstream |
| Multiple steps fail | **Partial:** re-enter at Construct for affected branch |
| Assumption wrong | **Full:** re-enter at Scope with new constraints |
| Over-planned | **ADaPT:** collapse remaining steps if complexity ≤5/12 |

**Replanning triggers explicit re-scoring.** Don't just patch — verify the patch against the same 6-layer test.

---

## Context Management

| Mechanism | Trigger |
|-----------|---------|
| **Compaction** — Summarize into knowledge artifact (Goal + Findings + Decisions + Open Questions + Files) | Context >80% capacity |
| **Plan Re-injection** — Load plan artifact into new context | New session / context reset |
| **State Resumption** — Load JSON state for exact position | Interrupted execution |
| **Structural Summary** — AST-level codebase map (functions, classes, interfaces) | Before planning on existing code |
| **Dependency Snapshot** — Import graph + call sites for impacted area | Before Construct phase |

---

## Agent Routing

SPECTRA is agent-framework agnostic. Map these capability classes to your agent system:

| Need | Capability Class | Handoff |
|------|-----------------|---------|
| Implementation | **Builder** (speed-class) | YAML spec + context files + gates |
| Complex reasoning | **Reasoner** (reasoning-class) | Full spec + extended context |
| Bug investigation | **Debugger** (diagnostic-class) | Fix spec + root cause + regression scope |
| Spec review | **Reviewer** (quality-class) | Draft + critique dimensions |
| Multi-agent work | **Orchestrator** (coordination-class) | Orchestration plan + assignments |
| Architecture | **Architect** (design-class) | Design decisions + constraint matrix |
| Codebase analysis | **Explorer** (retrieval-class) | Query + scope + retrieval hints |

---

## Memory

| Type | Purpose | Query When |
|------|---------|------------|
| Episodic | Past specs + reflections + outcomes | Pattern phase |
| Semantic | Templates, architectural patterns, conventions | Pattern phase |
| Procedural | Learned strategies, domain-specific heuristics | Scope phase |
| Execution | Plans, state files, replanning history | Re-entry, replanning |

Query memory BEFORE generating. ≥85% match → use template directly.

---

## Output Discipline (P0 — non-negotiable)

**All SPECTRA-produced files live under `.spectra/` in the consumer project.** This is a hard rule: the agent must not scatter specs, plans, state files, session logs, or any other working output into the project root, `docs/`, `notes/`, or any other location outside `.spectra/`.

**Canonical layout** (created by the retrofit tool or by the agent on first write):

| Location | Contents |
|---|---|
| `.spectra/setup/` | `project-profile.md`, `adaptation-prompt.md`, `spectra-conventions.md` — project fit (generated once by the retrofit tool; curated by the user) |
| `.spectra/plans/` | Plan artifacts, YAML handoffs, state JSON — per-feature spec outputs (primary agent output) |
| `.spectra/state/` | Optional: session resumption notes, checkpoint summaries |
| `.spectra/logs/` | Optional: replanning history, refinement cycle records |

**Rules:**

1. **Never** write a plan, spec, hypothesis, or state file to `./plans/`, `./docs/plans/`, the project root, or any path outside `.spectra/`.
2. **Before writing**, check that the target path starts with `.spectra/`. If a user explicitly requests an output elsewhere (e.g. "write the plan as `notes/new-feature.md`"), treat it as an override — but mirror-save the authoritative copy under `.spectra/plans/` regardless.
3. If `.spectra/` does not yet exist, create it (and the relevant subdirectory) rather than fall back to the project root.
4. `spectra-conventions.md` specifically lives at `.spectra/setup/spectra-conventions.md` and nowhere else. Never copy it into `.claude/`, `.cursor/`, `docs/`, or any vendor-specific folder — those hosts reference it via the filesystem, they don't own a duplicate.

Output discipline exists so agents don't dirty the consumer project and so `.spectra/` remains the single, predictable, git-commit-friendly surface for everything SPECTRA produces.

---

## Theoretical Foundations

SPECTRA's design decisions are grounded in decision theory, information theory, and cognitive science. For the formal treatment — including Expected Value of Information analysis for confidence gating, Shannon entropy-based adaptive verification budgets, Miller's Law justification for the 3–5 hypothesis range, scoring calibration protocols, and a formal failure taxonomy — see [THEORY.md](../research/THEORY.md).

## Project Conventions (optional)

`.spectra/setup/spectra-conventions.md` is SPECTRA's project-adaptation surface. When present, it maps the generic methodology concepts to the project's actual vocabulary — file paths, naming conventions, test framework references, deployment patterns. It's produced by a one-time in-project fit pass (run from the consumer host via a retrofit tool) and then edited by humans if the LLM-generated mapping needs correction.

**Operational behaviour is specified in CLARIFY step 4 and Pattern step 2** — the agent loads the file on every activation if present, treats its vocabulary as overriding SPECTRA's generic placeholders, and falls back cleanly to generic defaults when absent. The SPECTRA cycle, hypothesis diversity requirement, verification layers, confidence gating, and artifact persistence do not change per project.

The file lives at `.spectra/setup/spectra-conventions.md` and nowhere else — it is never duplicated into `.claude/`, `.cursor/`, or any vendor-specific folder. See **Output Discipline** above.
